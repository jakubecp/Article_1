## Spatial distribution modeling of Thanatophilus sinuatus (Coleoptera: Silphinae) in the Czech Republic

###Abstract
Carrion beetles of genus Thantophilus are an important part of the North Hemisphere ecosystems. They are providing valuable ecosystem services by promoting nutrient cycling and biological control of pests. The presence of Thanatophilus sinuatus is well known in the Czech Republic and our goal was to model the possible occurence by using statistical methods. The study based on observations of the species in the Czech Republic and other Central European countries.
